# Gas-Simulation
Gas simulation is a primitive method for visualizing how particles mix in the air. It handles collisions by considering particle mass and direction but does not account for diffusion. 
## Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible [here](https://wyatt-drew.github.io/Gas-Simulation/index.html).
